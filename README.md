# Buildspace NFT Game

Building a game alongside a [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) tutorial. This game allows the user to mint player NFTs on the Ethereum Goerli testnet through a React based web app.
I'm looking forward to expanding the UI and mechanics of this game to test my understanding of both Solidity and React.

## Running the React App
You can run the app locally by installing all the dependencies using

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev-start
```

# In Progress
Future plans include:
- Make "Toast" message a React component
- Expanding stats and creating more complex attacking mechanics
- "Multiplayer" component which will display the actions of other users who have minted characters
- Update UI visuals
